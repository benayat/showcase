# Showcase
Welcome to the Showcase repository! This is a React application designed to showcase my projects as a backend developer. The purpose of this repository is to provide a visual and interactive way for potential employers and other interested parties to explore my work.

The application is currently deployed on Netlify and can be accessed at https://benaya-showcase.netlify.app/.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```javascript
git clone https://github.com/benayat/showcase.git
cd showcase
npm install
```
## Running the Application
In the project directory, you can run:
```javascript
npm start
```
This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make changes to the code. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
## Testing
To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run:
```javascript
npm test
```
## Building for Production
To build the app for production, run:
```javascript
npm run build
```
This will build the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
## Deployment
The application is deployed on Netlify. After building the app for production, you can deploy it on your own by following the instructions provided by Netlify.
